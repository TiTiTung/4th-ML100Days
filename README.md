### Step 2: Write something in Markdown

Let's try it out!
Apply different styling to this paragraph:
**HackMD gets everyone on the same page with Markdown.** ==Real-time collaborate on any documentation in markdown.== Capture fleeting ideas and formalize tribal knowledge.

- [x] **Bold**
- [ ] *Italic*
- [ ] Super^script^
- [ ] Sub~script~
- [ ] ~~Crossed~~
- [x] ==Highlight==
